Abstract:
A simple server that in the end will be capable of:

    JOB                                    | STATUS
  1) managing up to N users at a time      | DONE :-)
  2) verifying passwords                   | DONE :-)
  3) keeping a list of known users         | DONE :-)
  4) hashing passwords                     | DONE :-)
  5) encrypting and decrypting using RSA   |

Current: RSA
  1) build a general class that receives a number and encrypt and decrypt with it
  2) before sending encrypt, after receiving decrypt

TDL:
    1) make prints on server synchronized |
    2) make prints robust                 |
